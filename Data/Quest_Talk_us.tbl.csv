"21","The brave group of Knights, Idid, the guardian of the Delos area, has disappeared due to the Igis' curse. At the same time, when Kashan Died, the dark army that was summoned to the Kelino Temple disappeared as well."
"22","A drunken monk was telling us that if we follow the trail in the purple forest, it will lead us to a golden Temple. We walked through the forest but didn't find any golden Temple. Instead we found a staff that was buried in cadavers, which seemed as old as the Temple itself. When Rapion possessed the Staff of Kashan the seal that had locked up the dark force was broken. The power of darkness took over the Kelino Temple. Bellier who was later notified of this incident sent out a group of Knights to the Temple to resolve the problem there, but the whole group was returned as cadavers. "
"23","[The answer can be found from the place of evolution.]|[What do you mean?]|Rapel the prophet continued telling his story.|[Kellino Temple was created by the Limphs that guards the 3 holy grounds.

"2004","In order to disable the curse, you need to receive a blessing from the Logos to change it to Talia Skin.. Do you want to do this?  I bet you do.. However.. I'm going to have to receive something in return for my blessing.. "
"2005","Lately, the guys in the 'Valley of the Lost Souls' are acting suspiciously. Their evilness must be supressed. In order to do this, I need a Bone of Dragon Tooth and the Blood of Dark Mage. "

"7006","Rogues should keep the seniors' secrets. Don't forget about keeping the secret!"
"7007","You're not ready yet. You do not have all the things that I require. "
"7011","In that case, I'll refer to the seniors about your specialty. "
"7050","Welcome to Moradon, the city of peace and trade! | I'm Proconsul, the master of blacksmith guild. I'm the head of all the blacksmiths!! We can make items that would be very tempting for warriors like you. || So, tell me. What're you looking for?"
"7105","Did you hear about the rumor that the Goblins lived in the deserted land had build their own village in both El Morad and Karus? "
"7110","To tell you the truth, we blacksmiths do not care about Goblins. However, we are interested in the armors that they are wearing."
"7120","Although the Goblins have poor skills in making armors, the quality of the materials they use are very nice. If we can just put a little finishing touch to it, I'm confident that it'll become a great armor!"
"7130","If you bring the Goblin Armor, I'll have our guild members repair it. If you don't have a nice armor yet, this should be a good chance for you to get one. Of course, nothing is free…, just a little material cost and a service fee, as you know, we need to make a living too. "
"7140","You can ask anybody in the square over there where you'll be able to meet Goblins. If you are lucky, maybe some kind person will help you. Well then, Take care!"
"7145","One thing to note is that for someone big like you will need [5 pcs. Of Goblin Armor]!! Think about Goblin's small size!"
"7150","You brought the Goblin Armor? Good, then I'll make an armor for you. I need 5 pcs. Of Goblin Armor to make one that would fit you. What kind of Armor did you get? Oh, one more thing.. You also need to pay the fee below in order to make the armor. || 100 thousand coin for Goblin Pauldron | 80 thousand coin for Goblin Pads | 50 thousand coin for Goblin Helmet | 40 thousand for Goblin Gauntlet | 30 thousand coin for Goblin Boots"
"7160","You should have at least 5 pcs. Of Goblin Armor to make one for yourself. Compare the size of your body with the Goblin's!"
"7170","Hmm... You don't have enough money. Sorry to say this but we won't be making any money if we charge you the just the material cost. "
"7190","Oh, you've really been to the Goblin village! You're much braver than I expected!"
"7200","As I told you before, we can make magic armors out of Goblin's armors. | But don't let the outer form fool you, the result may vary. | Some may become great armors, but in some cases, some may become some what less of a great armor.  "
"7210","I cannot tell what kind of armor will be produced. Well, what do you say? Do you want me to make one for you?"
"7220","Hmm.. In order to make a Goblin Pauldron.. Including material cost, service fees, and etc.. It'll cost you 100,000 coins. "
"7230","Hmm.. In order to make a Goblin Pad.. Including material cost, service fees, and etc.. It'll cost you 80,000 coins. "
"7240","Hmm.. In order to make a Goblin Helmet.. Including material cost, service fees, and etc.. It'll cost you 50,000 coins. "
"7250","Hmm.. In order to make a Goblin Gauntlet.. Including material cost, service fees, and etc.. It'll cost you 40,000 coins. "
"7260","Hmm.. In order to make a Goblin Boots.. Including material cost, service fees, and etc.. It'll cost you 30,000 coins. "
"7280","I guess you're not interested in Goblin Armors. Well then, farewell and come back again if you ever need our help. "
"7310","Oh boy.. This armor is a failure. I'm sorry.. Well it's not that bad, it'll still be useful, so please don't too disappointed. "
"7320","We can make this kind of armors out of most Goblin Armors. If you want a better one, please get more Goblin Armors. If you're lucky you might end up with a great armor. "
"7330","You must be a lucky guy to get such a great armor out of Goblin armor."
"7340","Oh, wow! You're very lucky!! An armor of this caliber will stand out wherever you go. "
"7350","Oh, my goodness! It's almost impossible to make such an awsome armor out of Goblin Armors…, you're really lucky. "
"7551","Do you want to know about Armor of Destruction? Or did you bring back the materials? "
"7553","Such adventurers like you might dream of becoming more stronger than others. Well then, do you have any idea what we're dreaming about? We want to make a sword with the sharpest blade and make solid armors that nothing can thrust through!! || With these goals, we don't stop feeding the fire, blowing with the bellows and striking irons, just like you, constantly trying to make yourself stronger. || While warriors would sell their souls to become stronger, we had made a deal with he magicians in order to make better items l "
"7554","Based on what we learned from the sorcerers, we poured magic forces from [Talisman of Destruction] into the burning furnace to make a new kind of metal. || When this new creation was made from the furnace, we shouted with joy. But soon, we were facing a problem. The metal was too hard and we couldn't change its shape with our hammers and anvil. In other words, it was impossible to make an armor out of this net metal. So we had no choice but to be satisfied by placing the sheet metals on a leather armor. This armor that we created is called the Armor of Destruction. "
"7555","And then we faced another problem. We were unable to fix the metal if it was broken. haha.. Although it's very strong, the Armor of Destruction doesn't last long. What do you think? The name suits the armor, right? || As I told you before, the Armor of Destruction requires [Scroll of Destruction] in order to be made. There are monsters called Hell Hounds in the El Morad and Karus. They originated from dead Smilodons that were brought back alive by eveil necromancers. When you kill them, you'll be able to get the [Talisman of Destruction]. "
"7556","Oh, one more thing!! After Brin Mine closed down, the [Iron Bars] are not sold in the market anymore. I'd like you to get some for me. The easiest way for an adventurer to obtain [Iron Bar] is to hunt Bulcans. They dig and feed on earth. They excrete the earth but the iron that was in the earth are stored in their body. "
"7557","Do you want more information? Okay then, listen up!! The service fee is flat, 500 thousand coins!! This includes the price for the leather armor and the service fee. Trust me, it's worth it!! |||Pauldron of Destruction : 7 pcs. of Talisman & 15 pcs. of Iron Bars | Pad of Destruction : 5 pcs. of Talisman & 12 pcs. of Iron Bars | Helmet of Destruction : 4 pcs. of Talisman & 9 pcs. of Iron Bars |Gauntlet of Destruction : 3 pcs. of Talisman & 6 pcs. of  Iron Bars | Boots of Destruction : 3 pcs. of Talisman & 3 pcs. of Iron Bars"
"7558","You brought the [Scroll of Destruction] and [Second Upgrade Protector]? And you didn't forget to bring 500,000 coins, right? Okay, tell me what kind of armor you want. "
"7566","Hey, you don't have enough coins!! Pauldron of Destruction requires 500 thousand coins. We need to make some profits in order to make better armors!! Some people think that we are thieves for charging such fees, but it costs us a lot to buy the materials for making an armor. I'll give you a discount when my business becomes more successful. "
"7571","To make an Armor of Destruction, we need [Iron Bar]. Do you understand? You can easily get [Iron Bar] from Bulcans. It's tough for a blacksmith like me to hunt Bulcans, but I'm confident that you'll be able to hunt them easily. |||Pauldron of Destruction : 15 pcs. of Iron Bar | Pad of Destruction : 12 pcs. | Helmet of Destruction : 9 pcs. | Gauntlet of Destruction : 3 pcs. of Talisman & 6 pcs. of Iron Bars | Boots of Destruction : 3 pcs. of Talisman and 3 pcs. of Iron Bar"
"7576","Hey!! You do not have enough scrolls. For a Pauldron of Destruction, [7 pcs. Of Scroll of Destruction] is need!!"
"7577","Hey!! You do not have enough scrolls. For a Pad of Destruction, [5 pcs. Of Scroll of Destruction] is need!!"
"7578","Hey!! You do not have enough scrolls. For a Helmet of Destruction, [4 pcs. Of Scroll of Destruction] is need!!"
"7579","Hey!! You do not have enough scrolls. For a Gauntlet of Destruction, [3 pcs. Of Scroll of Destruction] is need!!"
"7580","Hey!! You do not have enough scrolls. For a Boots of Destruction, [3 pcs. Of Scroll of Destruction] is need!!"
"7591","Behold! The Armor of Destruction! Please note that the Armor of Destruction cannot be repaired!! After using it, you'll have to sell them for scrap metal. So, don't come back later asking for a refund!!"
"7621","Oh~ Are you interested in Talia Skins?  Do you want to know what a Talia Skin is? Or did you bring the materials as promised? "
"7623","Let me tell you about the Talia Skin.  First of all, you should know what the Armor of Destruction is. Armor of Destruction is more stronger than anything else in the world!!  But it's really hard to maintain. You can't add magic powers or repair them. However, we found a way to insert a new kind of power within in these armors. We can use the Talisman of Talia and the Crystals that the Giants are carrying. "
"7624","The Talisman of Talia is a rare magical material you can get from the Giants.  Unlike us, the Giants cannot make such fine armors like us. They are strong enough to lift large bolders and throw them, but they are helpless against our swords and magic.
